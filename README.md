# 2022 Jeep.com Front Page Recreation

This is a from-scratch recreation of the Jeep.com front page in Spring, 2022.

It is built purely using HTML and vanilla CSS as an early project to learn and hone my CSS skills.

The page is responsive, and about as accurate of a reproduction as I could manage as the original page seemed to use obscure, calculated values in its design (I couldn't figure out a general pattern and had to measure everything individually).

Note that the interactive elements like the nav dropdowns, hero slider and certain links are not reproduced as no JavaScript was included in this project.

I later created the page, again from scratch, using Bootstrap (which includes some extra functionality afforded by that library) which you can view [here](https://github.com/me-julian/jeep-com-with-bs) and one of their forms [here](https://me-julian.github.io/jeep-com-inquiry/).
